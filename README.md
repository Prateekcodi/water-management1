# Smart Tank: Consumption Forecast + Leak Alerts

A comprehensive IoT solution for monitoring water tank levels, predicting consumption, detecting leaks, and providing real-time alerts using ESP32 and ultrasonic sensors.

## 🎯 Project Overview

A device that measures tank level, logs usage, predicts days until empty, detects leaks and pump faults, and notifies you. ESP32 handles sensing and connectivity while a lightweight server processes data for predictions and notifications.

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time tank level monitoring** with ultrasonic sensor
- **Consumption tracking** with flow sensors
- **Smart predictions** for days until empty
- **Leak detection** and pump fault alerts
- **Overflow protection** with automatic pump control
- **Web dashboard** with charts and notifications
- **Mobile-friendly interface**
